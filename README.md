# Flight Prices Prediction Using AWS SageMaker

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict flight prices using AWS SageMaker. The goal is to build a machine learning model that estimates flight prices based on historical data.

## Steps

1. **Setup AWS SageMaker Environment**
   - Create an AWS account and set up AWS SageMaker.
   - Configure IAM roles and permissions.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect and preprocess flight data (e.g., historical prices, flight features).
   - Upload data to an S3 bucket.

3. **Create a SageMaker Notebook Instance**
   - Launch a SageMaker notebook instance.
   - Install necessary libraries and dependencies.

4. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Load data from S3.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Clean and preprocess data (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling).

5. **Model Training**
   - Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Learner).
   - Split data into training and validation sets.
   - Train the model using SageMakerâ€™s built-in algorithms.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
   - Tune hyperparameters if necessary.

7. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the model as a SageMaker endpoint.
   - Test the endpoint with new flight data.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Monitor model performance over time.
   - Update the model as needed based on new data.
